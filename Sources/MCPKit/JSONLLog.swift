//
//  JSONLLog.swift
//  MCPKit
//
//  A tiny append-only JSONL store for an in-app MCP server's activity log. The headless
//  `--mcp` process is a separate launch from a running GUI, so it records what it does to
//  a small file in a shared container both can reach; a settings pane can tail that file.
//
//  It provides a `FileHandle`/`seekToEnd` append (creating the file on the first write), a
//  tolerant line-by-line parse that skips a torn or malformed line rather than failing the
//  whole read, a `maxEntries` cap, and a `clear()` that removes the file. The entry schema
//  and the cap are the generic parameters; each app keeps its own `Entry` type.
//
//  Concurrency: several MCP clients can each launch their own `--mcp` process, so writes
//  are append-only (small atomic appends). Trimming to the last N entries is done by the
//  single GUI reader when it loads, avoiding multi-process rewrite races. Every member is
//  nonisolated, so the headless server can append from any context.
//

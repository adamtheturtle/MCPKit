//
//  StdioBootstrap.swift
//  MCPKit
//
//  The stdio entry-point bootstrap for a host app built around `MCPServer`. When a host
//  binary is launched with `--mcp` it must NOT start its UI: it speaks MCP over stdio, so
//  its synchronous `main` needs to bridge to the async server and never return. This lifts
//  that shared shape here: detect the flag, read the bundle version, build the server, run
//  it over `StdioTransport`, and block the calling thread on a `DispatchSemaphore` until
//  the transport closes, logging any failure to standard error.
//
//  What stays app-side is passed in as closures: the enabled-gate check and any launch
//  side effect are service-specific, so `isEnabled` and `onLaunch` are supplied by the
//  caller rather than baked in.

    ///   recording the launch in an activity log. Defaults to a no-op.
